    "# Context maintenance strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "As agents interact with users and environments, the context they maintain must evolve to reflect new information. The strategy for updating context - whether to append new information, overwrite existing facts, version changes or intelligently merge updates - has profound implications for correctness, token efficiency and the ability to track how information changes over time. Each strategy represents different trade-offs between history preservation, storage efficiency and retrieval simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context maintenance is not a one-size-fits-all problem. Conversation histories benefit from append-only strategies that preserve every turn in order. User preferences might use update-in-place to maintain only current values. Important configuration might need versioning to track what changed and when. Multi-source data integration requires structured merging with conflict resolution. Understanding these strategies and their appropriate applications is essential for building agents that maintain accurate, efficient context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we explore the four primary context maintenance strategies and when to apply each. We will examine append-only approaches for preserving complete history, update-in-place strategies for minimal storage, versioned updates that track changes over time, and structured merging for intelligent conflict resolution. We will compare their trade-offs and learn to combine strategies into hybrid approaches that optimize for different types of information."

    "## Part 1: Append-only strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The append-only strategy never modifies or deletes existing context - it only adds new entries. This preserves complete history with perfect fidelity, maintaining temporal ordering and enabling full reconstruction of how context evolved. Every conversation turn, every event, every update gets recorded as a new entry in a growing log. This approach is invaluable when history matters, when audit trails are required, or when we need to understand the sequence of events that led to a current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of append-only as maintaining a journal where we never erase anything - qw only add new pages. When a user changes their mind about something, we don't go back and cross out the old preference; we simply write down the new one with a timestamp. This means we can always go back and see exactly what was said when. For conversations, this is natural: we would not delete parts of a chat history just because the topic changed. For events like purchases or updates, having the complete timeline helps with customer support, debugging and analytics. The append-only pattern mirrors how Git works with commits - nothing is ever truly deleted, only added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off is straightforward: append-only strategies consume storage and tokens linearly with the number of updates. As context grows, we must either retrieve selectively - taking only recent entries - or summarize historical context. The benefit is simplicity and completeness. Nothing is ever lost, contradictions are preserved rather than hidden, and we always have the raw material to understand what happened and when. When a customer service agent asks \"what did this user tell us three interactions ago?\", append-only gives us the exact answer immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining the basic append-only structure\n",
    "To implement append-only context maintenance, we need a way to represent individual pieces of information as discrete entries in a timeline. Each entry should capture not just the content itself, but also essential metadata that helps us understand the context of that information. The timestamp tells us when something was added, which is critical for temporal ordering and understanding the sequence of events. The entry type helps us categorize different kinds of information - is this a user message, an agent response, a system event, or something else? This categorization becomes powerful for filtering and retrieval later. Finally, we need a flexible metadata dictionary to store any additional context-specific information like source, confidence levels, user IDs, session identifiers, or any other attributes that might be relevant for specific use cases. This foundational structure gives us everything needed to build a complete, immutable history of context evolution."

    "Now let's build the `AppendOnlyContext` class that maintains a growing list of these entries and provides methods to retrieve them. The key principle is that the entries list is immutable in the sense that existing entries are never modified or deleted - we only append new ones. This class needs to support two primary retrieval patterns: getting the complete history for audit or debugging purposes, and getting recent history for efficiency when passing context to an LLM. The recent history pattern is particularly important because it allows us to manage token limits by selecting just the most relevant recent entries while keeping the full history available when needed."

This is invaluable for customer service scenarios where knowing the customer's journey helps provide better assistance, and for debugging situations where we need to understand why the agent made certain recommendations based on what information it had at each point in the conversation."

    "### Advanced append-only: Event sourcing pattern\n",
    "Event sourcing takes append-only to the next level by treating all changes as discrete events in a timeline. Instead of storing \"user's cart contains Product X\" as state, we store events like \"ProductAdded(X)\" and \"ProductRemoved(Y)\". The current state is derived by replaying all events from the beginning. This pattern originated in financial systems where every transaction must be traceable, but it is increasingly used in AI agents for its powerful audit capabilities and ability to reconstruct any historical state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of event sourcing is that the event stream becomes the single source of truth. If we want to know the state at any point in time, we replay events up to that moment. If there is a bug in our state-building logic, we fix it and rebuild from the events - the events themselves never change. This makes debugging easier: we can replay events with different logic, add logging or step through exactly what happened. For AI agents handling complex multi-step interactions, this visibility is invaluable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement an event-sourced system for a shopping cart scenario where we can track all user actions as discrete events. We will define the types of events that can occur, create an event structure with unique identifiers and timestamps, and build a system that can reconstruct the current state by replaying the event history. This demonstrates how event sourcing provides both complete auditability and the ability to rebuild state from scratch.\n",

Event sourcing is similar to database transaction logs or Git history - complete record of all changes.\n",

    "## Part 2: Update-in-place strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The update-in-place strategy modifies existing context when information changes rather than appending new entries. Think of it as maintaining a whiteboard where we erase old values and write new ones - only the current state is visible. When a user changes their budget from €1500 to €2000, we don't keep both values; we simply replace €1500 with €2000. This keeps context minimal and unambiguous, making it perfect for scenarios where only the current state matters and history provides no value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update-in-place is the most token-efficient strategy because context size stays constant regardless of how many updates occur. A shopping cart that gets modified 50 times still occupies the same space whether it has 1 item or 5 items - the number of modifications is irrelevant, only the final state matters. This makes update-in-place ideal for real-time systems, form data, current session state, and anywhere we need to minimize context window consumption. The agent never sees contradictions because old values are gone, replaced by current truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "The trade-off is permanent information loss. Once we update budget from €1500 to €2000, the original €1500 is gone forever. We can't debug why recommendations changed, can't audit what the user originally wanted, and can't rollback if the update was a mistake. For many use cases this is perfectly acceptable - a form field, a shopping cart, current search filters - but for others it is a critical limitation. Understanding when history doesn't matter is key to using update-in-place effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing basic update-in-place\n",
    "Let's build a simple key-value store that maintains current state with update timestamps for each fact. The core idea is straightforward: when we set a value, if it already exists, we simply overwrite it. No history is preserved, no versions are created - just direct replacement. This simplicity makes update-in-place extremely efficient both in terms of memory and computational overhead. The only concession to history we will make is tracking when each fact was last updated, which helps with understanding recency without storing full history."

    "### Advanced update-in-place: Structured state management\n",
    "While simple key-value storage works for flat data, real applications often need structured state with validation. Using Pydantic models for update-in-place provides type safety, nested structure management, and clear schemas that both humans and AI agents can understand. Instead of raw dictionaries, we define explicit data models that represent the shape of our state, ensuring updates maintain consistency and validity throughout the application lifecycle. The model acts as both documentation and validation - we can see exactly what fields exist, what types they should be and what constraints apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pydantic models also give us powerful features like optional fields with defaults, nested dictionaries and lists with proper typing, automatic validation when values are set, and easy serialization to JSON for persistence or API communication. For AI agent applications, this structured approach is particularly valuable because the schema itself can be included in the agent's context, helping it understand what information is available and how to update it correctly. Let's build a user profile management system using Pydantic that demonstrates these benefits while maintaining the efficiency of update-in-place.\n",

    "This approach provides efficient state management with validation but sacrifices auditability - there's no way to recover what the budget was before the update or see that LP001 was ever in the cart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of structured updates:\n",
    "  - Type-safe with Pydantic validation.\n",
    "  - Clear schema for agent understanding.\n",
    "  - Efficient storage of current state.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Part 3: Versioned updates strategy\n",
    "The versioned updates strategy keeps both current state AND change history by storing multiple versions of each fact. Think of it as Git for our context - every change creates a new version while preserving all previous versions. When a user changes their budget from €1500 to €2000, we don't choose between keeping one or the other; we keep both as version 1 and version 2. This gives us the best of both worlds: quick access to current state plus complete history for debugging, analytics and rollback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning solves a critical problem that neither append-only nor update-in-place can handle well: we need current state to be immediately accessible (like update-in-place) but we also need to track how it evolved over time (like append-only). With versioned updates, getting the current budget is a single operation - just grab the latest version. But if we need to debug why recommendations changed, we can walk through the version history: v1 was €1000, v2 was €1500, v3 is €2000. Each version can optionally include a reason for the change, creating a narrative of decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storage cost is higher than update-in-place but more structured than append-only. Instead of keeping every conversation turn mentioning budget, we keep only the distinct budget values as versions. This is much more efficient than full append-only while providing similar historical reconstruction capabilities. The trade-off is implementation complexity - we need to manage version lists, decide what to include in context (current only? recent history? full history?), and potentially implement time-travel queries or rollback functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use versioned updates:\n",
    "- User preferences where we need both current values and change history.\n",
    "- Configuration management where rollback might be needed.\n",
    "- Debugging scenarios where understanding state evolution is critical.\n",
    "- Analytics that track how user needs evolve over time.\n",
    "- Audit requirements that demand versioning but not full append-only logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement versioned updates, we need a system that tracks each distinct value a fact has held over time, along with metadata about when and why it changed. The foundation is a version object that bundles together the version number, the actual value at that version, a timestamp marking when this version was created, and optionally a human-readable reason explaining why the change occurred. This creates a rich historical record where we can look back and understand not just what changed, but when and why it changed. Then we need a context manager that maintains lists of these versions for each fact, providing methods to add new versions, retrieve the current latest version efficiently, access any historical version, and view the complete evolution of how a fact changed over time. Let's start by defining the structure for a single version."

    "### Advanced versioning: Time-travel queries\n",
    "Time-travel queries extend versioning to answer temporal questions: \"What was the state at 2pm yesterday?\" or \"What changed between Monday and Wednesday?\" This powerful capability enables debugging (\"what was the budget when we made that recommendation?\"), compliance (\"show me the state during the audit period\"), and analytics (\"how did preferences evolve during the marketing campaign?\"). By combining version history with timestamp filtering, we can reconstruct any historical state or analyze change patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on top of versioned updates, we can implement powerful time-travel capabilities that let us reconstruct the exact state of the context at any moment in the past, or analyze all changes that occurred within a specific time window. This is incredibly valuable for debugging scenarios where we need to understand what the agent \"knew\" at the moment it made a particular decision, or for compliance audits that require showing the state during a specific period. The key insight is that by walking through our version history and filtering by timestamps, we can answer temporal questions without needing separate snapshots or backups. Every historical state is implicitly available in the version log, we just need the right query methods to extract it. Let's extend our `VersionedContext` class with time-travel methods."

    "## Part 4: Structured merging strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The structured merging strategy intelligently combines new information with existing context using configurable conflict resolution rules. Unlike the previous strategies that either keep everything (append-only), keep nothing (update-in-place), or keep versions (versioned), structured merging makes intelligent decisions about how to handle conflicts when new data arrives. Should we keep the old value, use the new one, combine both or apply custom logic? The answer depends on context, and structured merging provides the framework to express these rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Merging becomes critical when context comes from multiple sources with different reliability levels. Imagine an e-commerce agent receiving budget information from three sources: user explicit statement (€1500), browsing history (€1000), and saved preferences (€1200). Which is correct? With priority-based merging, we assign each source a priority - user input might be priority 10, saved preferences priority 7, browsing history priority 5 - and the system automatically keeps the highest-priority value. This prevents low-quality data from overwriting high-quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond priority, structured merging offers multiple strategies for different data types. Lists might use APPEND to combine values from multiple sources. Dictionaries might use MERGE_DEEP to recursively combine nested structures. Timestamps can drive TAKE_NEWER logic. Each field can have its own merge strategy and provenance tracking shows exactly where each piece of data came from. This level of control is essential for production systems where data quality and consistency are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use structured merging:\n",
    "- Combining information from multiple data sources (user input, databases, APIs, inference).\n",
    "- Updating complex nested structures (user profiles, configurations).\n",
    "- Resolving conflicts with explicit policies (priority, recency, custom logic).\n",
    "- Maintaining data provenance (tracking where each field came from).\n",
    "- Systems requiring conflict resolution guarantees.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a structured merging system, we first need to define the different strategies for handling conflicts when new data arrives. Different types of data require different merge behaviors - sometimes we want to keep the existing value, sometimes we want to overwrite it, sometimes we want to combine both values, and sometimes we need to make intelligent decisions based on metadata like timestamps or source priority. By defining these strategies as an enumeration, we create a clear vocabulary for expressing merge policies that can be applied consistently across different data types and sources. Let's start by defining the available merge strategies."

    "### Advanced merging: Conflict resolution with LLM\n",
    "While rule-based merge strategies work well for structured conflicts where priority or recency can make the decision, some conflicts require semantic understanding to resolve properly. When a user says \"around 1500 initially and later says \"1500-2000 range\", these aren't simple contradictions - they are complementary pieces of information that a human would naturally understand as refining rather than replacing. An LLM can understand this nuance and intelligently merge the values into something like \"€1500-2000 budget range\" that captures both pieces of information. This LLM-assisted merging is particularly valuable for natural language data where strict rule-based strategies would either lose information or create nonsensical combinations. Let's extend our structured merge context with LLM assistance for handling semantic conflicts."

Append-only keeps both values in chronological order, update-in-place keeps only the final value, versioned keeps both as distinct versions with metadata, and structured merge tracks the provenance of each update.

    "## Putting it all together: Hybrid approach\n",
    "In real production systems, we rarely use just one strategy for all our context data. Different types of information have fundamentally different requirements - conversation history benefits from append-only preservation, current form state needs update-in-place efficiency, important user preferences deserve versioned tracking, and user profile data from multiple sources requires structured merging. The key insight is that these strategies are not mutually exclusive - we can and should use multiple strategies simultaneously, each applied to the type of data it handles best. A hybrid context manager combines all four approaches, routing each piece of information to the appropriate storage strategy based on its semantic meaning and access patterns. This gives us the advantages of all strategies while mitigating their individual weaknesses, at the cost of slightly increased complexity in the context manager itself. Let's build a comprehensive hybrid context manager that demonstrates how to combine these strategies effectively."
