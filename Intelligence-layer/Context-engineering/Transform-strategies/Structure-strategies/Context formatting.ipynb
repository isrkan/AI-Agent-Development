    "# Context Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "When an AI agent retrieves information from various sources - RAG systems, tool calls, memory, API responses - that information often arrives as raw, unstructured text. Before passing this content to the language model, we must decide how to format it. The format we choose is not cosmetic. It directly affects how well the model reads, reasons over, and uses the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook covers five practical formatting options: **Markdown**, **JSON**, **XML**, **TOON** and **plain text**. Each has a different structure, a different level of verbosity, and works better for different types of content. We will rewrite the same retrieved context in all five formats, send it to the model, and compare the results."
