    "# Salience Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models do not weigh all parts of their input context equally. Research on attention mechanisms reveals that models exhibit both primacy effects, where information near the beginning of the prompt receives stronger weighting, and recency effects, where content near the end is more heavily considered. Information buried in the middle of long prompts often receives diminished attention, leading to degraded performance when critical instructions or facts are positioned in these attention valleys. This uneven weighting becomes particularly problematic in production systems with complex prompts containing hundreds or thousands of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salience ordering addresses this challenge by strategically positioning content based on its importance and the model's attention patterns. Rather than organizing context chronologically or haphazardly, this technique places the most critical instructions and information in attention zones where models naturally focus: early in the prompt and near the end. Supporting details, background context, and less critical information occupy the middle regions where reduced attention has minimal impact. This deliberate positioning ensures that essential guidance reaches the model with maximum effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement salience-based context ordering from basic approaches to production-ready systems. We will explore attention pattern analysis, simple critical-first reordering, multi-zone optimization that leverages both primacy and recency effects, dynamic salience scoring for automatic prioritization, and complete salience managers with configurable attention strategies. The techniques shown here are essential for building robust prompts where critical information consistently influences model behavior regardless of total context length.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Primacy and recency effects\n",
    "The primacy effect means information presented early in the context receives stronger weighting in the model's processing, while the recency effect means information presented late is more readily accessed during generation. Information in the middle of long contexts suffers from both diminished attention and potential interference from surrounding content. This creates a U-shaped attention curve where the beginning and end are privileged positions."

    "## Simple salience-based reordering\n",
    "The most straightforward application of salience ordering is to manually tag context items by importance and place critical items at the beginning where primacy effects are strongest. This simple approach requires explicit salience annotations but provides immediate improvements for prompts where certain instructions or facts are clearly more important than others. By ensuring critical content appears early, we maximize the probability that the model will attend to and follow these essential elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement a basic reordering system that accepts context items with importance levels and automatically sorts them to place high-salience items first, medium-salience items in the middle, and low-salience supporting content last. This creates a simple but effective attention-aware prompt structure where the most important guidance consistently receives strong model attention."

This dual-positioning strategy ensures that essential instructions bracket the prompt, receiving attention from both early and late processing stages.\n",

    "Manual salience annotation becomes impractical for large-scale systems where context items are generated dynamically or come from multiple sources. A more scalable approach uses heuristic rules or lightweight models to automatically compute salience scores based on content characteristics. Items containing constraint keywords, formatting requirements, or explicit instructions receive higher scores, while background information and examples receive lower scores. This automatic scoring enables salience ordering without requiring manual annotation for every context item.\n",

    "We will implement a dynamic salience scorer that analyzes content to identify high-salience indicators such as constraint language, requirement keywords, critical markers, and formatting specifications. The scorer assigns numeric salience values that can be used for automatic reordering, making salience optimization practical for production systems that handle diverse and dynamically generated context."

This system is lean and focused on the core problem: ensuring critical information reaches the model with maximum effectiveness by leveraging attention patterns.\n",

Content from diverse sources—retrieved documents, tool outputs, conversation history, system instructions - can all be added through the simple `add_item` interface. The manager automatically determines importance, distributes items across attention zones, and constructs prompts where critical constraints consistently influence model behavior. This eliminates the manual prompt engineering overhead while significantly improving reliability for production AI systems where instruction adherence is critical."
