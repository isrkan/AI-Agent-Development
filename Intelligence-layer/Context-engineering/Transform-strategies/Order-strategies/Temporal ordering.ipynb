    "# Temporal Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "When prompts contain events, conversations, or facts with temporal relationships, presenting them in chronological order helps language models better understand causality and event sequences. Models process narratives more effectively when events flow from past to present, making it easier to identify cause-and-effect relationships and understand \"what happened when and why.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal ordering is simply organizing time-dependent information chronologically. In practice, this usually means sorting events or messages by their timestamp. This straightforward technique dramatically improves model comprehension of event sequences and causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the practical application of temporal ordering in AI agent context engineering, showing the problem, the simple solution, and real-world use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common use cases:**\n",
    "1. **Conversation history**: Order messages chronologically for natural flow.\n",
    "2. **Event logs**: Sort incidents/alerts by time for root cause analysis.\n",
    "3. **Document versions**: Present history from oldest to newest.\n",
    "4. **Multi-turn interactions**: Maintain temporal context across turns."
