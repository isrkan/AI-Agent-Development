    "# Instruction Distillation\n",
    "\n",
    "In complex AI agent systems, instructions and operational guidelines often accumulate over time, becoming lengthy, repetitive, and difficult for language models to process efficiently. A system prompt might start concise but grow to hundreds of lines as edge cases are addressed, examples are added and behavioral guidelines expand. Long instruction sets consume significant context space, increase processing time, and can dilute the model's attention to the most critical directives. When instructions contain redundancy, verbosity, and low-priority details alongside essential rules, the agent may struggle to identify and prioritize what truly matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instruction distillation addresses this challenge by synthesizing long or repetitive instructions into compact rules that preserve intent while reducing cognitive load. Rather than presenting the agent with verbose guidelines, we extract the core principles, consolidate redundant rules, and express constraints concisely. This distillation maintains the essential behavioral guidance while dramatically reducing token consumption and improving the agent's ability to understand and follow critical directives. The result is a streamlined instruction set that communicates the same requirements more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement instruction distillation from basic consolidation techniques to production-ready systems. We will explore redundancy elimination, rule consolidation, principle extraction, and complete distillation pipelines that transform verbose instruction sets into concise, effective agent guidance."

    "## Basic redundancy elimination\n",
    "The simplest form of instruction distillation involves identifying and removing redundant statements that express the same rule or guideline multiple times. As instruction sets evolve, similar directives often get added in different contexts or phrasings, creating unnecessary repetition. These redundancies waste tokens and can confuse the agent by presenting what appears to be multiple distinct rules that are actually the same requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement basic redundancy elimination that identifies semantically similar instructions and consolidates them into single, clear statements. This rule-based approach uses the LLM's understanding of semantic similarity to detect when multiple instructions convey the same intent, then merges them into a unified directive. While straightforward, this technique often yields significant compression and clarity improvements."

    "Instruction prioritization uses structured classification to organize rules by importance level.\n",
    "- The `PrioritizedInstructions` model defines three tiers (critical, important, preferences) with clear semantic meanings, plus a rationale dictionary explaining why certain rules are marked critical.\n",
    "- The `prioritize_instructions` function constructs a detailed prompt that defines each priority level with explicit criteria: critical for security/privacy/safety/legal requirements that must never be violated, important for quality standards and best practices that should normally be followed, and preferences for optimizations and stylistic choices. The LLM analyzes each instruction against these criteria and classifies it appropriately.\n",
    "- In the example, security-related instructions like \"never execute system commands without authorization\", \"always sanitize user input\", \"never expose API keys\", and \"do not access files outside workspace\" get classified as critical because they involve security and data protection. The rationale might explain that exposing API keys could lead to unauthorized access and security breaches.\n",
    "- Important-tier instructions include audit logging and proper input handling - serious but potentially with exceptions. Preference-tier instructions include markdown formatting, concise responses, code examples, and caching - nice-to-have optimizations that improve user experience but aren't critical to safety or correctness.\n",
    "- This hierarchical organization serves multiple purposes: it helps the agent prioritize when guidelines conflict, it makes clear which rules are absolute versus flexible, and it enables intelligent context management where preferences can be compressed or dropped if context space is limited while critical rules always remain. The structured format also makes it easy to programmatically enforce that critical rules are always included in the agent's context."

    "The `InstructionDistillationPipeline` integrates all distillation techniques into a unified production system. \n",
    "- The `DistilledInstructions` model captures the final organized instruction set with separate lists for each priority tier plus metadata about compression achieved.\n",
    "- The distill method applies transformations in sequence: first eliminating redundancy to remove duplicate guidelines, then consolidating specific rules into general principles, and finally prioritizing to organize by importance. Each stage builds on the previous one's output, creating progressive refinement. The pipeline tracks both instruction count and character count to measure compression at multiple levels.\n",
    "- The `format_for_prompt` method generates a well-structured text format suitable for direct use in system prompts, with clear section headers emphasizing critical constraints and optional inclusion of preferences.\n",
    "- In the example, a 20-instruction set goes through full distillation: redundancy elimination might reduce it to 12-15 instructions by merging similar rules about authentication and validation; consolidation might reduce it further to 8-10 by abstracting specific validation rules into general principles like \"validate all user inputs against expected formats and constraints\"; prioritization then organizes these into tiers, with security-related rules (authentication, authorization, input sanitization, credential protection) classified as critical, quality guidelines (logging, professional tone) as important, and formatting preferences (markdown, bullet points) as preferences. The final result might be 3 critical principles, 3-4 important guidelines, and 2-3 preferences, achieving 50-60% compression in instruction count and similar reductions in character/token usage.\n",
    "- The formatted output presents these in a clear hierarchy that makes it immediately obvious which rules are absolute constraints versus flexible preferences. This production pipeline enables systematic optimization of agent instruction sets, maintaining behavioral requirements while dramatically reducing cognitive load and context consumption."
