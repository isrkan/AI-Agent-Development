    "# Planning pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "When faced with complex, multi-step problems, an AI agent benefits from thinking ahead before acting. Just as humans plan their approach to large projects by breaking them into smaller tasks, AI agents can do the same through the planning pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "The planning pattern is an agentic design approach where the agent first generates an explicit plan - a structured breakdown of the task into smaller, manageable steps - before executing any actions. Instead of immediately jumping into tool calls or producing output, the agent pauses to think strategically: What are the sub-goals? What order makes sense? What dependencies exist between steps? This pattern is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "- Complex tasks requiring multiple coordinated steps.\n",
    "- Problems where the order of operations matters.\n",
    "- Situations where we want transparency into the agent's reasoning process.\n",
    "- Tasks that benefit from upfront decomposition before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement a planning-based agent that:\n",
    "1. Receives a user request.\n",
    "2. Generates a structured plan breaking the task into steps.\n",
    "3. Executes each step in sequence.\n",
    "4. Returns the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives us visibility into how the agent thinks and allows for better error handling, progress tracking, and the ability to modify plans dynamically if needed."
