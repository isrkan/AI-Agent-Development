    "# Ensemble multi-agent pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "In many domains, combining multiple independent solutions produces more reliable results than any single solution alone. This principle - the wisdom of crowds - applies to AI systems as well. Just as polling multiple experts and aggregating their opinions often yields better predictions than relying on a single expert, AI agents can benefit from ensemble approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble multi-agent pattern is an approach where multiple independent agents solve the same problem, then their outputs are combined through aggregation, voting or averaging to produce a final answer. Each agent works in isolation without seeing others' solutions until the aggregation phase. This pattern is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "- Tasks where diversity of approaches improves robustness.\n",
    "- Problems where single agents might have biases or blindspots.\n",
    "- Scenarios requiring high confidence and reliability.\n",
    "- Situations where we want to reduce variance in outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement an ensemble multi-agent system with truly independent agents:\n",
    "1. **Conservative agent:** Independent agent with low temperature for logical, systematic reasoning.\n",
    "2. **Balanced agent:** Independent agent with medium temperature for pragmatic reasoning.\n",
    "3. **Creative agent:** Independent agent with high temperature for exploratory, novel insights.\n",
    "4. **Ensemble coordinator:** Orchestrates parallel invocation and aggregates results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how multiple independent agents, each potentially using different reasoning strategies, can be combined to produce more robust and reliable answers than any single agent."

    "In this example, we see the ensemble pattern in action:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Conservative agent:** Provides systematic analysis of established challenges (radiation, life support, cost) and proven opportunities (scientific discovery, resource utilization). Focuses on well-documented facts and logical reasoning.\n",
    "2. **Balanced agent:** Offers pragmatic perspective balancing technical challenges with economic and political opportunities. Considers multiple viewpoints and practical implications.\n",
    "3. **Creative agent:** Explores innovative angles like space-based manufacturing, interplanetary internet, or novel propulsion. May surface less obvious opportunities that other agents miss.\n",
    "4. **Aggregation:** The coordinator identifies consensus areas (high confidence findings like radiation and life support challenges) and unique insights from each agent (creative opportunities, pragmatic considerations, systematic analysis). The final answer combines systematic rigor, pragmatic balance, and creative vision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ensemble approach produces a more comprehensive, robust answer than any single agent by:\n",
    "- Reducing variance: Conservative agent provides reliability.\n",
    "- Balancing perspectives: Balanced agent ensures practicality.\n",
    "- Surfacing insights: Creative agent finds novel angles.\n",
    "- Aggregating wisdom: Final answer benefits from all three.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is ideal for tasks where reliability matters, single solutions might have blind spots, or where diversity of approaches improves outcomes. The ensemble ensures the final answer benefits from multiple independent perspectives, producing more robust results than any single agent."
