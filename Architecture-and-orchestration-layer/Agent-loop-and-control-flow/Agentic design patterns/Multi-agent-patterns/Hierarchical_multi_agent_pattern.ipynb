    "# Hierarchical multi-agent pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex tasks often require diverse expertise and coordination between different specialists. Just as a company has managers who delegate to specialized teams, AI systems can benefit from a hierarchical structure where a coordinator agent directs specialized worker agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hierarchical multi-agent pattern is an organizational approach where one agent acts as a manager or coordinator that analyzes tasks, breaks them down into subtasks, and delegates each subtask to appropriate specialized worker agents. Each worker is an independent agent with its own reasoning loop and capabilities. The manager collects results from workers and synthesizes them into a final response. This pattern is particularly valuable for:\n",
    "- Tasks requiring different types of expertise (research, analysis, calculation, writing).\n",
    "- Complex workflows where subtasks need to be identified and assigned.\n",
    "- Scenarios where clear delegation and result aggregation are needed.\n",
    "- Situations where we want centralized control over the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement a hierarchical multi-agent system with:\n",
    "1. A **research agent** - An independent agent specialized in finding information.\n",
    "2. An **analysis agent** - An independent agent specialized in analyzing and interpreting data.\n",
    "3. A **writer agent** - An independent agent specialized in creating well-structured summaries.\n",
    "4. A **manager agent** - The coordinator that delegates to and orchestrates the worker agents with dynamic routing decisions and quality review capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates how multiple independent agents can collaborate under central coordination to solve complex tasks more effectively than any single agent could alone."

      "\n",
      "### Summary\n",
      "In summary, supervised learning focuses on training models with labeled data to make predictions, while unsupervised learning aims to discover patterns in unlabeled data. Each approach has its unique applications, strengths, and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of problems in machine learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Considerations\n",
      "- **Use Cases:** Supervised learning is commonly used in applications like fraud detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. Unsupervised learning is often applied in market segmentation, anomaly detection, and recommendation systems.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Techniques such as semi-supervised learning combine elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning, leveraging a small amount of labeled data alongside a larger set of unlabeled data to improve model performance.\n",
